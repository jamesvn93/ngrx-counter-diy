# ngrx-counter-diy


This is a "try it yourself" example of a counter app using NgRx in Angular. The basics of the app are implemented, but you will need to manually implement the actual NgRx store logicâ€”including actions, effects, reducers, and selectors. This project is designed to help you learn by building out the state management yourself.

For more information and documentation, visit the official NgRx site: [https://ngrx.io/](https://ngrx.io/)
