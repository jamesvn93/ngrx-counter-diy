import { createSelector } from '@ngrx/store';
// import your AppState and CounterState here

// INSTRUCTIONS:
// Create selectors to access pieces of state from the store.
// 1. Start by writing a function that selects the counter slice from your AppState.
// 2. Then, use createSelector to create a selector for the counter value.
// For example, you might:
// - Select the counter state from the root state
// - Use createSelector to get the value property from the counter state

// Tip: Think about how you would access the counter value in your component. What would you need to select from the store?
